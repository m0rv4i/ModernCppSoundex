# Soundex

A structured implementation of the first **Soundex** example from Chapter 2 of **Modern C++ Programming with Test-Driven Development**.

This was developed on Windows and includes some details to make that work.

## Building

We use CMake:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

Then you can use the build/soundex.sln file in Visual Studio.
